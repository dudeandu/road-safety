<p>The general analytic approach for this work is to visualize the historical record then fit trend lines to each city. This approach permits the basic exploration of past years as well as rudimentary predictions for the near future. Because there are many measurements for each city, it is possible to isolate variance both within- and between-cities. When this variance is visualized as 95% confidence interval bands, cities may be directly compared to determine the statistical significance of any differences.</p>

</div>
<p>The rate of pedestrian and cyclist fatalities per 100,000 residents are plotted in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:per-capita-metro">3.1</a>. The trend line for each city is fitted to the raw values using a simple least squared error method <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Due in part to the basic estimation process, the trends for New York City and Toronto appear to intersect in 2015. This result indicates Toronto is more dangerous to pedestrians and cyclists than each other city on a per capita basis, both in terms of the actual fatality rate in 2015 and in terms of the fatality rate trend.</p>

<p>A more sophisticated regression model was built with the <strong>nlme</strong> library in order to obtain a more accurate line estimate that properly accounts for both within- and between-city variance. The fitted city intercepts and slopes are available in Table <a href="appendix.html#tab:trend-table">6.1</a>.</p>
\begin{align*}
    fixed &amp;= \text{fatalities} \sim 1 + \text{year} \\
    random &amp;=~ \sim 1 + \text{year} ~ | ~ \text{city}
\end{align*}
<p>The fitted results of this model are plotted in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:trends">3.2</a>. The trend lines were then extended into the future in order to predict pedestrian and cyclist fatality rates. If these trends hold for the next four years, then Toronto is on track to become more dangerous to pedestrians and cyclists than every other city in the study. By 2015, Toronto has already become indistinguishable from London, and by 2019, Toronto matches New York City’s rate. During the same prediction interval, both London and New York City are seen to become safer for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

<div id="individual-cities" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Individual Cities</h2>
<p>Because we have many observations for each city, it is possible to use the variance between these observations to test for statistically significant differences in average fatality rates between cities. A basic <em>t-test</em> of this kind may visualized with the help of 95% confidence interval bands that surround each city’s trend line. When the confidence interval from one city does not contain the trend line of the other city, then the city fatality rate trends are significantly different. This sort of analysis may be interpreted similarly to a <em>t-test</em>.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3.3: Toronto and New York City pedestrian and cyclist fatality rates are visualized, along with 95-percent confidence intervals.
</p>
</div>
<p>In 2009, New York City had the greatest pedestrian and cyclist fatality rate among all cities included in the study, with an average of 0.685 pedestrian and cyclist fatalities per 100,000 residents. The 7-year fatality rate trend for New York is slightly negative (slope = -0.003), whereas the 7-year fatality rate trend for Toronto is positive (slope = 0.017). These trends, along with raw data, are visualized in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:nyc-toronto">3.3</a>.</p>
<p>Toronto caught up to New York City in 2013, at which point the two cities were no longer significantly different in terms of fatality rates. By 2015, Toronto actually surpasses New York City with the highest fatality rate that year, although the difference is still not yet statistically significant. When the trend lines are extended into the near future, we would expect to find that Toronto will become significantly more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists than New York City. As New York City was previously the most dangerous, Toronto is therefore trending to become most dangerous among the 7 cities studied.</p>

</div>
<p>Amsterdam is an interesting city for comparison to Toronto because it is widely touted as a model transit city balancing the requirements of automobiles, pedestrians, and cyclists. Importantly, it is often claimed that the Amsterdam model delivers increased safety. If these safety claims are true, Amsterdam would provide a baseline fatality rate representing what might be obtained through transit policy alone.</p>
<p>To investigate, Toronto and Amsterdam are plotted in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:amsterdam-toronto">3.4</a>. Based on our seven-year observation, only Copenhagen is safer than Amsterdam for pedestrians and cyclists (see Table <a href="appendix.html#tab:trend-table">6.1</a>). In fact, Toronto does not appear to be significantly more dangerous than Amsterdam to begin with <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. However, during the observation period, Toronto rapidly pulls away from Amsterdam to become significantly more dangerous to pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
