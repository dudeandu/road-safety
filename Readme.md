# Road Safety Study

Toronto pedestrian and cyclist fatality data were collected for the 7-year period of 2009-2015. Similar data were collected for comparable cities: New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen. Yearly *per capita* fatality rates were calculated based on Metro Area populations.

This analysis suggests that in 2009 Toronto was one of the safer cities in the study.  However, by 2015 Toronto had risen to the highest number of pedestrian and cyclist fatalities per capita among the 7 cities studied, and is trending to become significantly more dangerous than all other cities studied.
